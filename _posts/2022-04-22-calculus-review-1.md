# Calculus review: basic properties of numbers

Hi folks!
This is my first blog post on my website on Github Pages platform (cudos to the creators of it) and I will not start with an introduction today, but rather step in directly to the topics we'll discuss today.
Shortly speaking: I have a degree in applied mathematics, but as a data scientist with a lot of experience in DE and not in research I tend to forget a lot of things I used to study in uni. I'm going through Spivak's book right now and my main focus is proofs (which sometimes are kinda complex even for a simple things), so in the 1st post we'll start with simple basic properties of numbers proofs.

We'll begin with a few properties, we'll prove some of them.
(P1) if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are any numbers, then $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$
(P2) if $a$ is any number, then $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$
(P3) for every number $a$ there is a number $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$

Assertion: if ![\Small a + x = a] for any number, then $x = 0$
Proof:

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
